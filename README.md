ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION CARD GAME:

The purpose of this game is to test the player's memory. 
Playing cards are laid upside down in rows. 
The number of rows/card is left to the discretion of the player(s) and usually increases with larger number of players. 
In essence, the cards are arranged in a grid.
The goal of the game is for a player to get as many pairs as he or she can, but the pairs have to match.
There are many ways the cards can be matched- by number, by suite, or by color. 
This game can be multiplayer or singleplayer.
The player that collected the most pairs is declared the winner.
If playing singleplayer, you can play against a number of turns and/or time, or against the computer.
