ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION CARD GAME:

The purpose of this game is to test the player's memory. 
Playing cards are laid upside down in rows. 
The number of rows/card is left to the discretion of the player(s) and usually increases with larger number of players. 
In essence, the cards are arranged in a grid.
The goal of the game is for a player to get as many pairs as he or she can, but the pairs have to match.
There are many ways the cards can be matched- by number, by suite, or by color. 
This game can be multiplayer or singleplayer.
The player that collected the most pairs is declared the winner.
If playing singleplayer, you can play against/or keeping score of a number of turns and/or time, or against the computer.


<><><><><><><><>PSEUDOCODE FOR THIS VERSION CONCENTRATION CARD GAME<><><><><><><>

The game will initialize once the player opens up the browser page

The player will be faced with two rows of 5 cards each

The player will click on a card to turn it up, then the player will click a second card up in an effort to match it exactly

If the second card does not match, it will not flip, making the game more challenging on the player's memory

Two guesses (clicks on two different cards) will be considered one full turn.

If the cards match, they will remain up showing their match, and the player will continue to another turn.

The game will keep a count of the number of turns/guesses the player has taken up until player matches all cards

Once the player has matched all cards, the game will automatically restart

If player wants to reset before all cards are matched, player can click on the 'restart game' button.

At the start of every new game, the cards will be shuffled to ensure randomness and the counter will be back to 0
